### Overview of jBallerina 1.2.41

The jBallerina 1.2.41 patch release improves upon the 1.2.40 release by addressing an [issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/pull/40997).

You can use the update tool to update to jBallerina 1.2.41 as follows.

**For existing users:**
If you are already using jBallerina version 1.2.14, or above, you can directly update your distribution to jBallerina 1.2.41 by executing the following command:

```
bal dist update
```

However, if you are using

- jBallerina 1.2.0 to 1.2.13, run `ballerina dist update` to update
- jBallerina 1.2.0 but being switched to a previous version, run `ballerina dist pull jballerina-1.2.41` to update
- a jBallerina version below 1.1.0, install via the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/)

**For new users:**
If you have not installed jBallerina, then download the [installers](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) to install.
